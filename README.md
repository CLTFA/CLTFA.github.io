The website for CLTFA, the Chinese Language Teachersâ€™ Federation of Australia.

### TODO:
* Full fill with infomation on each page.
* Documentation.
* CNAME settings. Need to have the domain.
* `<blockquote>` can have a better format.
* Reconsider the image/document hosting service.
 * Onedrive does not suppor png/gif.
 * It does not provide direct download link to a office file.
 * It works terrible in China.
* Make a gallary-like image shower.
* Be more responsive.
* etc.

### Post tips:
* Now `<h5>` (or `#####` in markdown) is used for image annotations.
